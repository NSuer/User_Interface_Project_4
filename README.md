- I used chat gpt with the prompt "Using Vite and svelte, Make a website that uses the computers mic to change an indicator from green to red based on the noise level of the environment." to make a very basic form of my webpage. It was useful in getting the mic working and connected but is no where close to my final website. It really only gave me a decibel reading and a circle that changes colors.
