# User_Interface_Project_4
This webiste only works on google chrome right now. I have tested on firefox and it doesn't work. 

## AI Use 
- I used chat gpt with the prompt "Using Vite and svelte, Make a website that uses the computers mic to change an indicator from green to red based on the noise level of the environment." to make a very basic form of my webpage. It was useful in getting the mic working and connected but is no where close to my final website. It really only gave me a decibel reading and a circle that changes colors.
- I use github copilot when I code. I use it more as an auto-complete rather than it generating large portions of code.
